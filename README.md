Lexington bike lane optimization project

Riding bikes is a crucial piece of a larger transportation sustainability puzzle. Bikes are some of the most energy-efficient machines we have. In cities with car-prioritizing infrastructure (e.g. most US cities, including Lexington), choosing bike routes that feel safe can involve considerable detours. Fortunately, many cities have begun retrofitting car-centric infrastructure with more bike-friendly features. The optimization model we produce gives a potential answer to the question "What are the best roads on which to build bike-friendly infrastructure to minimize the amount of safety-detouring?"
